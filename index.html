<h1> The Norm and Exceptions </h1>
<p1>
In the book, Cairo discusses norms and exceptions. Now reminder these norms and exceptions aren't what you are expecting probably. They are discussing norms with data sets like mean, median, mode, and range. The reason to do this is understand trends and the way data can be applied in real life.
</p1>
<h2> Mode </h2>
<p1>
In the book mode is defined as the measure of central tendency. Basically it is the number that occurs the most in the data set. It is important to see what is the most repeated piece of data in the set.
</p1>
<h3> Median </h3>
<p1>
The median is the value that divides the set in two halves. This number is not nearly as important as the rest because it the least talked about in the book.
</p1>
<h4> Mean </h4>
<p1>
Mean is the average in the data set. Mean is very sensitive to extreme values. Meaning that once a data point is put in that is far larger than the rest it will affect it in a large way. There are also different means like the grand mean, which is just a mean of all collective means in a data set.
</p1>
<h5> Range </h5>
Range is the difference between the first and second data set. With range, you can make range charts that are very useful in helping the data be easily viewed. With range charts the user can make a variety of inferences based on the information that is displayed with each of them.
